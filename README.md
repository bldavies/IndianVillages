# IndianVillages

IndianVillages is an R package containing data on social networks in rural Indian villages.
It provides the following tables:

* `households`: household attributes.
* `household_relationships`: inter-household relationships.

I derive these tables from survey data collected by [Banerjee et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1236498) as part of their study of microfinance diffusion.
