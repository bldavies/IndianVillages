# IndianVillages

IndianVillages is an R package containing data on social networks in rural Indian villages.
It provides the following tables:

* `households`: household attributes.
* `household_relationships`: inter-household relationships.

I derive these tables from survey data collected by [Banerjee et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1236498) as part of their study of microfinance diffusion.

## Installation

IndianVillages can be installed as follows:

1. Clone or fork the repo.
2. Download [datav4.0](https://doi.org/10.7910/21538/4POS1J) from the Harvard Dataverse, save it in `data-raw/`, and unzip it.
3. Run `make` in a Terminal window at the repo's top-level directory.
